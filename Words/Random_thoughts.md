Today on 24th of November, I was hit by some big thoughts. I wanted to share these deep thoughts.
I was talking with my friend why we are studying so hard in order to go to a foreign country.
And then we both knew the answer to that. I never thought of this way when I was in high school or college. But after entering into the career world, I found the reality of this country.
I am proud to say, Nepal is the country holding Everest, having muti religion and so peaceful.
But deep inside I know that there is not even a single sector that has a growth potential out here. I have heard many relatives saying you have so much money in Nepal, why should we go abroad or stuffs like why produce for other countries. I want to give an answer like bam in their face, and that is we have no satisfaction out here, there is a dead end of work.
Let me say this in lamman's term, we are from pre school tgought to love our country and all those stuffs, and when we grow we have no any education system that leads us to choose fields we want. So its like following the huge heard of sheeps. What education my mother use to get, its the same for us. Generation gap is like 30 years but is there no any advancement in education all these years?
That education system is the main cause leading all the talented youngsters to go abroad or work for abroad.
Today we were actually talking about her pharmacy struggle journey in Nepal, and how happy yet challenged she feels when she hears and sees what the same occupation is treated in abroad.
I really don't know what to say, what is missing out here, what can be done? But one thing is for sure if this goes on, Nepal will be fully and wholly dependent on India, even the basic needs.
Pleading and begging is our way of life nowadays here.
That's it for today. Randomizing my thoughts and keeping it together. Hope I can right good about my country one day in the future with a magic. Kidding.
