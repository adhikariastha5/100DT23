Some basics about python,numpy and pandas
1. Some basics print statement, list, dictionary, file handling (tuple,sets)
2. Numpy intro and adventageous with the array python.(homogeneous)
- Functionality, speed in numpy
- intialize diff arrays, array arithmetic, indexing, slicing(gives range of values in form of matrix)
- aggrigation like max,sum
- indexing,slicing
3. Pandas is like excel sheet(heterogeneous like diff vector together)
4. Homogeneous coordinates(merging two pictures)
5. Linear regression (we take errors betn obs and pred the square them and take derivative.. to minimize error --> and we have derivative with respect to m or b and get two values)
- 2d array always for fit and prediction of model
- inplace=True ...removes from the original dataset
- x,y must have slope=1
- how is the correlation found?
- TP(Predicted right),FN(Falsely as negative but was positive),FP(Falsely prdeicted positive but was negative),TN(Predicted right but no)
