- Imagenet has large scale image. Handcrafted image are hard to design. In Deep learning we should not focus on features, only focus on logic.
- Going beyond eucledian distance
# Deep Learning fundaments by Danda Pani Poudel
- Good learning rate
- Jacobian
- Loss function and batch normalization.
- Overfitting,optimum,underfit
# Pytorch Lab Session
