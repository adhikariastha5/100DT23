# 3D Vision by Ajad Chhatkuli
- Computer graphics and 3D Vision
- given 3D shapes and motion, we construct realistic image
- given images, infer the motion and shapes
- 1980 it already have reconstruct (make 3d image)
- Augmented/virtual reality
- we can take satellite images, take drones and servey and construct 3d image of data.
- image at right and left eye are different, projection of object changes, it shifts and this is known as disparity.
- Paralax is
- chicken has eyes in two different sight and they do not have 3d image so they move the head in front.
- pinhole camera model,one ray going from object to projection image( all 3d uses this)
- image plane; image .....
- Projection matrix,linear form
# Distribution Learning Theory by Danda Pani Poudel
- Looking at data sample we want to know what is it and how good is it?
- In other side of the wall, there lives another sort of target is hitting and so on.
- For twins, it is difficult for us to recognize one from another. Uncertainity is their in reality too, not that we are not smart.
- generative story, belief-hypothesis is that data is not generated randomly, there is smth happening that generate smth and this has uncertainty(intent and uncertainty prospective)
- mixture-model(joined and marginial distribution----> imp)
-
