This is the DrivenData challenge in Richter's Predictor: Modeling Earthquake Damage. It is mainly just for the learning purpose.

Problem Description

We're trying to predict the ordinal variable damage_grade, which represents a level of damage to the building that was hit by the earthquake. There are 3 grades of the damage:

1 represents low damage
2 represents a medium amount of damage
3 represents almost complete destruction
